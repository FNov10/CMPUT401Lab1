q2) 2.28.1
q3) 2.28.1
q4) virtul environment fetches the latest version of the libraries, in this case req
request, so if i already had an older version of requests on my machine
and ran the script on the venv, it would pull the latest version of the
library, not the one on my machine


diff? get req other is a post request
